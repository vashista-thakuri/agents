# AI AGENTS


This is a command-line AI assistant that can answer your questions, perform web searches, and summarize results using large language models. When you ask a question, the assistant responds directly. If your question includes phrases like "search" or "look up," it fetches the latest information from the web using the SerpAPI and summarizes the findings for you. The assistant is designed to be concise and helpful, only revealing its name or origin if specifically asked.

To use the application, simply run it in your terminal, type your question, and receive an answer or a summarized web search result.

## Sample Output

Below is an example of the application's output, so you know what kind of answers to expect:
